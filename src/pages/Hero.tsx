          LNURLwallet is a static page with no backend of its own. It holds
          LNURLcash bearer notes - LNURL-withdraw links whose k1 is the asset -
          from any number of mints, encrypted with a key derived from your seed
          phrase and stored only in this browser's local storage.

          <h3>Bearer notes (LUD-25)</h3>
          <p>
            A note is a plain LNURL-withdraw link whose k1 is the asset -
            whoever holds it controls the sats. Any wallet can cash one out;
            this one can do much more.

        <div class="hero-feature">
          <IoLockClosedSharp />
          <h3>Encrypted at rest</h3>
          <p>
            Every note is AES-GCM encrypted with a key derived from your linking
            key before it touches local storage - and the linking key itself can
            be password-encrypted too.
          </p>

          <IoServerSharp />
          <h3>Many mints, one wallet</h3>
          <p>
            Notes carry their issuing service with them, so one wallet holds
            LNURLcash from any number of independent mints side by side.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="hero-feature">
          <IoGitBranchSharp />
          <h3>Melt, split, combine</h3>
          <p>
            Melt a note into any bolt11 payment, split it into change, or merge
            same-mint notes into one.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="hero-feature">
          <IoSaveSharp />
          <h3>Backup &amp; restore</h3>
          <p>
            Download all your bearer notes as one file - still encrypted,
            exactly as stored. Restore them anywhere with your seed phrase.
          </p>

          <h3>Optional hardware vault</h3>
          <p>
            Pair an LNURLvault device over USB or Bluetooth, or a standalone
            Heartwood over its authenticated relays. It takes over generating
            and holding your note secrets - this wallet only ever keeps a blank
            mirror of what's on it, never the real thing.
